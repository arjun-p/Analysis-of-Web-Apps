(1) Copy all files downloaded from SVN into a new directory.  That way if I need to update the files, your SVN update won't clobber your local modifications.
(2) Place config files in the base directory of the events and bookstore apps
(3) Modify config files "classpath" attribute to point to the directory containing your compiled classes
(4) Update config.sh with your local directories
(5) Update the wam.properties attributes
(6) Run "wam-pda.sh events" or "wam-pda.sh bookstore"
